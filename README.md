# Dotfiles

*Inspired by [@nqthqn](https://github.com/nqthqn/)’s [dotfiles](https://github.com/nqthqn/dotfiles)!*

## Installation

Clone repo in home directory, then run [`install.zsh`](install.zsh).

## Notes

1. In order to avoid putting personal info into version control, and to keep out cruft added by apps (I’m looking at you [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)), the installation script creates a [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) and imports the one found in this repository.

2. More coming soon!
